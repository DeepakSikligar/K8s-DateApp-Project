# Objective Statement

To create a Kubernetes deployment with pod(s) and job(s).

A job that runs every minute which appends the current date and time to persistent data storage on the cluster, and a service endpoint
available to CURL against so that end users can read a list of the last 5 job outputs,returned as JSON.

Allowed to use any language/framework of your choice for the implementation
of this server, providing the required Docker build file alongside the application code.

 We suggest keeping it simple. If your code requires compilation, you do not need to include
the compiled binaries, but please provide instructions on how to build them.

Your solution should include a README file that clearly documents how to deploy your
code, any assumptions made, any additional work you would carry out to turn this into a
production deployment, and how to CURL against your exposed service.

we recommend you use Minikube as your Kubernetes cluster. 
The documentation on how to push a custom Docker image to the Minikube in-cluster Docker daemon can be found here.

-----------------------------------------

Deployment -- pod -->>  read the last 5 job outpits in JSON
cronjon -->> write to file - volume
Svc ---> Expose svc publicly ---> on the above Deployment --> Get output in JSON
Volume - PV,PVC
